## Functionalities

### `Times(long times, int limit, Func<long, Task> method)`

Executes an asynchronous method n number of times, limiting the amount of operations in parallel without blocking.

Returns a `Task` that is completed when all Tasks are completed or is faulted when any of the Tasks transition to faulted state.

Suitable for benchmarking asynchronous methods with different concurrency limits.

**Example**

```csharp
// Execute MyMethodAsync 1,000,000 times limiting the maximum amount of parallel async operations to 512
await ConcurrentUtils.Times(1000000, 512, (index) => MyMethodAsync());
```

### `Map(IList<TSource> source, int limit, Func<TSource, Task<TResult>> method)`

Asynchronously projects each element of a sequence into a new form, limiting the amount of operations in parallel without blocking.

Returns a `Task` that gets completed with the transformed elements or faulted when any of the transformation operations transition to faulted state.

**Example** 

```csharp
var urls = new []
{
    "https://www.google.com/",
    "https://www.microsoft.com/net/core",
    "https://www.nuget.org/",
    "https://dotnet.github.io/"
};
// Asynchronously get the http response of each url limiting
// the maximum amount of parallel http requests to 2
string[] responses = await ConcurrentUtils.Map(urls, 2, url => client.GetStringAsync(url));
```

### `CreateQueue<T>(int limit, Func<T, Task> method)`

Creates collection of objects to which apply the asynchronous method in a first-in first-out manner. Items added to the queue are processed in parallel, up to the concurrency limit.

Returns a `IJobQueue<T>` instance that can be used to enqueue items.

**Example** 

```csharp
// Create the queue providing the method that is going to be used to asynchronously process
// each item and the concurrency limit
IJobQueue<string> jobQueue = ConcurrentUtils.CreateQueue(2, url => client.GetStringAsync(url));
// Add items to the queue that are going to be processed according to the concurrency limit
Task t1 = jobQueue.Enqueue("https://www.google.com/");
Task t2 = jobQueue.Enqueue("https://www.microsoft.com/net/core");
Task t3 = jobQueue.Enqueue("https://www.nuget.org/");
Task t4 = jobQueue.Enqueue("https://dotnet.github.io/");
// Items are processed as FIFO a queue, without exceeding the concurrency limit
await Task.WhenAll(t1, t2, t3, t4);
```
